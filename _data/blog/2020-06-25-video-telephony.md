**Videotelephony**comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of[audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal "Audio signal")-[video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video "Video")signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real time.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony#cite_note-McGrawHill-1)A**videophone**is a[telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone "Telephone")with a[video display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device "Display device"), capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in[real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing "Real-time computing").**Videoconferencing**implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a**videoconference**.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony#cite_note-Mulbach-1995c-2)[Telepresence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence "Telepresence")may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called "visual collaboration" and is a type of[groupware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupware "Groupware").

While development of video conferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at "booths" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T to launch the first true video conferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included "image phones" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional[plain old telephone service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service "Plain old telephone service")(POTS) lines, essentially the same as[slow-scan TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television "Slow-scan television"). The development of advanced[video codecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec "Codec"), more powerful[CPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU "CPU"), and high-bandwidth[Internet telecommunication services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol")in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low-cost colour service between users almost any place in the world where the Internet is available.

Although not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include[sign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language "Sign language")transmission for [deaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf "Deaf") and [speech-impaired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disorder "Speech disorder")people,[distance education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_education "Distance education"),[telemedicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemedicine "Telemedicine"), and overcoming[mobility issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability "Disability"). It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships.[News media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media "News media")organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like[Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype "Skype")to provide higher-quality audio than the cellular phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphones "Smartphones").
