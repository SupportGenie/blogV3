# **How Capitalizing On Virtual Reality Can Save Businesses from Sinking?**

By: [Harmeet Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harmeetwrites/)

Are you a business owner struggling to resolve a large number of customer issues which have instantly picked up since the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the World?

Have you ever experienced agitation from customers due to not resolving the simplest request?

Everywhere around the globe, consumers are facing issues with prompt action on their customer support requests. Either minimum or no support agents are available due to strict governmental lockdowns ever since the COVID-19 has hit the national and international boundaries.

Many companies have shut their business, completely or partially, leading to sustainability issues. At the same time, the customer base has shifted to their competitors who have been quick in offering advanced **tech support solutions** that utilize Artificial Intelligence. The use of **live software** support through remote assistance has helped many businesses in performing even better with or without human involvement.

Companies have struggled with deploying Virtual Reality due to several reasons that majorly involves a cultural resistance to change and fear of eliminating human capital. It’s critical for a business to understand that technology is invented to support a human function rather than overtaking human roles. Remote assistance through VR has allowed support agents to offer assistance regardless of their location. For example, if your customer wants to set up a TV remote for his newly bought smart television and is unable to do so himself. He can simply get a real-time guidance through virtual assistance, which is quicker and much more efficient. It allows the support agent to demonstrate the step-by-step procedures of installation for the customer using a real-time application.

It is a proven fact that humans learn more effectively by observation rather than reading. VR performs over the limitation of a mere **computer software** to enable read only support. The real estate industry is currently setting a big example of rendering A-class customer service through VR.

Considering that you want to sell or purchase a real estate property but have restrictions due to everchanging regulations or rules within your city/county/state—considering the present global pandemic. The real estate agent through VR can show 3D images of the property, allowing you to feel as if you are actually there. It takes you inside the virtual world allowing you to feel things in real time and take decisions. This is how realtors are deriving most of the benefits from **software support** amalgamated with Artificial Intelligence and VR.

## **Is VR a threat to Human-Based Customer Service?**

The answer is a big 'NO’. VR is not here to take over human roles. It is there to support humans to perform even better where empathy and decision making is required. The customer service department works on a personalization model. Hence, to foresee VR taking up human roles is nowhere close to imagination. This AI-driven solution with constant up-gradation and involvement of BIG data may appear as real as human and the distinguishing line keeps diminishing. There is a huge potential of VR in customer service, especially for the companies associated with automotive, gaming, manufacturing video, products and services, etc.

## **Take a Test Drive with VR**

VR is not only beneficial for customer service, but it can also be a great tool to help product testing and research departments. It’s unique ability to allow a real-time test drive or usage for products like automobiles or machinery, managers can present product and function efficiently and effectively.

At the same time, allowing customers to check or compare a new product range for potential purchases.

## **Shopping Backed by Virtual Reality can be the ‘New Normal’**

VR is helping retail stores exhibit and facilitate the launch of new products, be it from any category, from accessories to clothing. Major online shops introduce customers with their products through either photos or videos. Customers can have a real time shopping experience without visiting a brick-and-mortar store with VR-enabled platforms. Looking at the ongoing pandemic, virtual shopping will become the new normal with added VR experiences which are already gaining much buyer attention.

If we talk about the future of Virtual Reality, it is going to replenish the history of entire customer service, all for its own good. Although the implementation at first may appear a bit ‘huge on the pocket’ but as this **customer support tool** continues growing with AI, can become an asset on improving the customer experience in real-time. You should always remember that satisfied customers set a base for self-promotion through ‘word of mouth’ publicity. That saves huge money for any business in the longer run. As older as your VR support may turn, as efficiently it may progress in the number of queries it can address with complete resolution.
