# How to Provide World Class Support like a Pro

By: Harmeet Singh

Customer service is an integral yet less valued part of any business. There is a common misconception about customer service departments having the most unoccupied labor. Hardcore customer service professionals define their role as critical as any programmer, a marketer or any finance officer within an organization.

However, the point here is, why the customer service department gets criticized over and again. By nature, customer service is not a thankless job at all. There are examples of many industry giants that have earned repeated purchases by offering impeccable customer service and have rewarded their customer service’s staff. Hence, the lack of support is not from personnel. The underlying issue is certainly the inefficient process and infrastructure with the organization itself. It’s no wonder, why we see many companies outsource their customer support process.

Today, the market is flooded with bottleneck competition and intelligent buyers. In order to stand out from the rest, companies need to reconsider their approach towards establishing a **customer support system**. It doesn’t matter to a customer, whether you outsource customer service or design a built-in channel. Naturally, people want an immediate response for quick resolution, failing to provide this may cost your customer’s loyalty. A repeat customer saves six times the cost of building a new customer. Companies need to set their priorities straight. The power a repeat customer possesses is their ‘word of mouth’, which as we know is completely free of cost and will generate more business. A loyal customer is earned through exceptional ‘customer service’. Are we ready for it?

Companies need to rethink the way they have been delivering customer experience. In this process, companies should self-doubt, whether, the existing system of handling issues or problems is sufficient for the customer. The big picture is whether companies are ready to embrace technology to support customer relations.

Many customer satisfaction studies and surveys have estimated that around 60% of companies fail to respond to customer service emails. They even fail to send acknowledgments, take feedbacks or give a full response in one go. This is actually upsetting! This gives a clear picture of how the majority of companies have fallen short in meeting customer expectations.

However, the world needs to learn from selective giants that have laid down beautiful principles of customer service by offering customer support amalgamated with AI. Here’s how you too can achieve customer loyalty and brand recognition, just by delivering the right kind of customer support.



## Respond to Each Line, Don’t Ignore

A customer support professional knows every answer all the time. Hence, it is often seen that customers get their questions either half answered or not answered at all. To overcome this, there should be a clear set of rules in the e-mail client or **customer service tool** to help automate forwarding requests to the proper department at the right time (that starts as soon as the customer query comes in).

Do NOT ignore customer questions at all! If you do, they will ignore you and you know what it means and how much it may cost to your business. 



## Integrate Technology, Adopt AI

To run a smoother customer service process and deliver high-ended experience, integrate technology to help segregate between high and low priority requests. This can be done by installing AI-supported chatbots too. [**Support Genie**](https://supportgenie.io/?utm_source=how-to-provide-world-class-support-like-a-pro&utm_medium=blog) does just that, you too should do! 

Integrated AI technology allows customers to reap the maximum benefit of a LIVE chat support platform using high-ended interactions. Also, support via a chatbot leverages the ultimate convenience by allowing customers to talk or inquire about their issues right from their own smartphone. Customers who gets an ease to talk to you, gets a reason to come back to you, of course for repeated purchase. 

Automate your process by sending automatic emails pertaining to receiving requests, work in progress and resolved requests. Do NOT keep them wondering about the query that they made last. Integrate automation.



## Encourage Feedback

Never really push your customers but utilize the power of automation by requesting feedback. This instills a thought that says, ‘you care’. You really do, probably this is the reason why you are investing time in learning tactics of delivering a world-class experience. So, go ahead and ask for feedback from your customer, whether, it is after sales or after a query resolution. Do NOT forget to take feedback, just don’t push them, I insist!



## Quality Over Quantity

Most disadvantageous can be the judgment of customer service personnel on the basis of queries resolved, rather, it should be the type(s) of queries resolved. Every individual is different, hence, there can be people who are quick and efficient while others can be intense problem solvers and may be some that can pacify the problem customers best.

Identify and pick among your agents to resolve specific customer requests as per their capabilities and not according to a set monopoly. This will drive quality conversations among your customers and support agents which can further increase customer relations.



## Empower Support Agents

Deploy competitive tools backed by Artificial Intelligence. These can be real-time software, chat supports or chatbots, integrated email client(s) etc. to help put support agents to more complex query resolutions and effective management of time. Utilizing AI support can be the best decision an organization may take due to its quirkiness, swift communication, excellent UI, speed & accuracy which are much needed to satisfy customers and resolve bulk queries.

**Support Genie** can help smoothen your customer service process with utmost precision by enabling remote support for your customers using AI-driven technology and high-ended interactions. A lot of customers have ranked Support Genie’s chatbot #1 in terms of UI, design and ease of use on smartphones and devices. If you haven’t installed chatbot support for your customer, then, you should think about installing one before it’s too late. With all the advantages that an automated system can offer, investing in one can be beneficial for your business in the long-run.
