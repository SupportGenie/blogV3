## How to Provide World Class Support like a Pro

By: Harmeet Singh

Customer service is an integral yet less valued part of any business. There is a common misconception about a customer service departments to have the most unoccupied labor. Hardcore customer service professionals define their role as critical as any programmer, a marketer or any finance officer within an organization. 

However, the point here is, why the customer service department gets criticized over and again. By nature, customer service is not a thankless job at all. There are examples of many industry giants which have earned repeated purchases by offering impeccable customer service and have rewarded their customer service’s staff hugely. The underlying issue is certainly an inefficient process and infrastructure. It's no wonder, why we see many companies outsource their customer support process.

Today, the market is flooded with bottleneck competition and intelligent buyers. In order to stand out, companies need to reconsider their approach towards a customer support system. It doesn’t matter to your clients, whether you outsource customer service or design a built-in channel. All they want is an immediate response system in place for quick resolution, failing which may cost you customer loyalty. A repeat customer saves six times the cost of building a new customer. Companies need to set their priority straight. A loyal customer is also responsible for spreading ‘word of mouth’, which is completely free of cost. Hence, providing world-class support results in more business. A loyal customer though, is earned through exceptional ‘customer service’. Are we ready for it?

Companies must rethink the way of delivering the best customer experience possible. In this process, companies should self-doubt, whether, the existing system of handling tickets is doing any justice to their customers. Companies should question, whether, they are ready to embrace technology to support customer relations? 

Many customer satisfaction studies and surveys have estimated that around 60% of companies fail to respond to customer service emails. They even fail to send acknowledgments, take feedbacks or give full response in one go. This is actually upsetting for most! Missing contact information on business site(s) can leave customers suspicious about any businesses. This gives a clear picture of how the majority of companies have fallen short in meeting customer expectations.

However, the world needs to learn from selective giants that have beautifully laid down principles of customer service by offering customer support amalgamated with artificial intelligence. Here’s how you too can achieve customer loyalty and brand recognition–deliver the right kind of customer support is the key to world-class support.

Respond to Each Line, Don’t Ignore

A customer support professional doesn't know the answer every time. Often do customers get their questions fully, it's either half answered or not answered at all. To overcome this, there should be a clear set of rules in the email client or customer service tool to help automate the escalation of severity to the proper department at the right time (that starts as soon as the customer query comes in).

Do NOT ignore customer questions at all! If you do, they will ignore you and you know what it means and how much it may cost to your business. 

Integrate Technology, Adopt AI

To run a smooth customer service process and deliver high-ended experience, integrate technology to help segregate between high and low priority requests. This can be done by deploying AI-supported chatbots. Support Genie, a provider of integrated customer support systems, does just that and you should too. 

Customers reap the maximum benefit of LIVE chat support while using high-ended interactions. Also, chatbots can leverage customer communication channels by inquiring using their mobile phones, which is the most convenient way of engaging with the customer. Be reminded, with chatbot support, you do not just deliver customer experience but also convenience of using their mobile phones. Customers who gets an ease to talk to you, gets a reason to come back to you, of course for repeated purchase. 

Automate your process by sending automatic emails pertaining to receiving requests, work in progress and resolved requests. Do NOT keep them wondering about the query that they made last. Integrate automation. 

Encourage Feedback

Never really push them but utilize the power of automation by requesting feedback. This instills a thought that says, ‘you care’. You really do, probably this is the reason why you are investing time in learning tactics of delivering a good customer experience. So, go ahead and ask for feedback from your customer, whether, it is after sales or after a query resolution. Do NOT forget to take feedbacks, just don’t push them, I insist!

Quality over Quantity

Most disadvantageous can be the judgment of customer service personnel(s) on the basis of queries resolved, rather, it should be the type(s) of queries resolved. Every individual is different, hence, there can be people who are quick and efficient while there can be intense problem solvers and may be some can pacify the problem customers best.

Identify and pick among your agents to resolve specific customer requests as per their capabilities and not according to a set monopoly. This will drive quality conversations among your customers and support agents which can further customer relations to its best shape. 

Empower Support Agents

Deploy competitive tools backed by Artificial Intelligence. These can be real time software, chat supports or the chatbots, integrated email client(s) etc. to help put support agents to more complex query resolutions and effective management of time. Utilizing AI support can be the best decision an organization may take due to its quirkiness, swift communication, excellent UI, speed and accuracy which are much needed to satisfy customers and resolve bulk queries.

Support Genie can help smoothen your customer service process with utmost precision. We can help enable remote support for your customers using AI driven technology and high-ended interactions. A lot of customers have ranked Support Genie chatbot no.1 in terms of UI, design and ease of use. It can run competently on Android devices, also it works on devices using iOS. If you haven’t installed chatbot support for your customer, then, you should think about installing one before it’s too late. With all the advantages that an automated system can offer, investing in one can be a beneficial for your business in the long-run.
